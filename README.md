## Hello! 🌸

I'm Neko, currently based in Qatar.

I am an aspiring software developer with basic C knowledge. I am still learning how to program properly.

My main future target is building softwares and robots that makes our life even more easier.

I also have a vision for building an Operating System but it's a long way to go.

### Facts about me:
- A curious person wanting to know about how something works or what something is.
- Hobbies: Drawing, Experimenting softwares, Reading Novels and Manga, Watching Series and Movies.
- Used various Linux based distros and Void Linux was my favorite before moving to Secureblue a more secure Linux based distro.

### Thanks a lot for visiting and viewing my profile! ❤️
